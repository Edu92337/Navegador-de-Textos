# Text Navigator

This project is an application of **doubly linked lists** to simulate the functioning of a **browser history** in an interactive terminal interface. The goal is to explore concepts of **dynamic data structures** and provide the user with intuitive navigation through the entered texts using the `curses` library.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Description

The program allows the user to:
- **Type sentences** and store them in a doubly linked list.
- **Navigate through the sentence history** using the **arrow keys**.
- **View the number of steps** each sentence is away from the most recent entry.
- **Delete characters with Backspace** during typing.
